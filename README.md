# Job search program

A program that allows you to quickly filter through 1000's of job postings to find the very exact jobs you're interested
in.

Here's some of the problems I had with job boards in general when job hunting.

- Can't mark a job posting as seen, or ignore that job posting.
- Lots of irrelevant job postings that just matched a keyword in your search.
- You won't end up seeing some jobs. A board may have 3,000 remote java jobs, but you're not going to make it to the end
  page of results.
- Each job board has a different format, a different UI, different features, different types of jobs, would be nice if
  they were unified.

## Features

There's only a few features. 
- One is the main page, where you can see all the job listings in your database.

- Underneath the job title, you can click one of the status buttons to categorize the job posting.
