# Job Scraper

It's like an applicant tracking system, but in reverse. Let's you sift through
a load of job descriptions and shortlist the jobs you are interested in.

## todo

Statuses

- New
- Decline
- Interested
- Applied
- Interviewing
- Rejected

Show if the company already has other postings that you have assigned non new status
to. This way we can see what we already thought of some of their job postings and 
it might jog our memory.

Filter by status. We should definitely want to see jobs of a certain status, like applied.

Filter by company. To see all jobs by company regardless of status.

Filter by companies with a certain status. To see all of the companies that have a certain status.

Filter by search term. Search makes sense, even better if added highlighting.

Notes on the job, should be easy to add notes to keep track.
