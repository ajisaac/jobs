# Job search program

A program that allows you to quickly filter through 1000's of job postings to find the very exact jobs you're interested
in.

I was looking for a job one day and really thought all the job boards were clunky, showing lots of uninteresting
results, and generally just not an optimal experience. I was tracking my applications in a spreadsheet, but decided
a database may be better. I then added a simple UI in front of the database.



## todo
Clean up and sanitize html from scrapers, remove class names, inline styles, any scripts, etc.
